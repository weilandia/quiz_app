# ### Basic Requirements
# * The program should prompt the user for the number of questions to put in the quiz. Any integer value greater than 0 is acceptable.
# * The expected output is to display a list of question_ids
# * Use each strand as close as possible to an equal number of times. (e.g. There are two strands, so if the user asks for a 3 question quiz, it's okay to choose one strand twice and the other once.)
# * Use each standard as close as possible to an equal number of times.
# * Duplicating questions in the quiz is OKAY!
# * Not completing the basic requirements IS NOT FAILURE.  We'd rather see a beautiful attempt than a complete attempt.
# * Please use git to track progress. E.g. progressively commit changes so we can track your thought process.
